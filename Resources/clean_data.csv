It looks like at the strongest damage point it was estimated that the tornado was 75 yards in width. Just across from the park to the northeast, the roof of a house was nearly completely destroyed. There was a carport attached to the roof which was demolished, and the roof was then lifted off and carried across maybe 20 yards across the street and impacted another house. This second house had the cars in the driveway lifted and turned a few feet. The home suffered structural damage to the front wall with cracks spreading towards the back of the home. These two homes appeared to suffered the most direct damage. Turning north down the road, the neighborhood had similar damage to siding of the homes as most of the damage came from a southwest to northeast direction. Snapped trees, patio furniture tossed, and broken windows were the most common impacts. Near the end of the path, a large shed's roof was lifted off and carried a few feet away. About 3/4 mile northeast of the start point, the tornado likely weakened as the damage becomes more minor consisting of roof siding damage and snapped twigs. On the northern sides of homes, hail damage was evident due to hail being driven onto the sides of homes on the north side of the tornado.

The tornado continued on to the east-northeast, producing mostly tree damage as it crossed Cypress Road and Albert Barr Road. In addition, falling trees downed many power lines in this area as it moved to the northeast for two to three miles. The most significant damage occurred a little farther to the northeast as the tornado crossed Wheeler Road. At this location, there were a few collapsed electrical transmission towers which were rated as high-end EF-2 damage with estimated 130 mph winds. From here, the last few miles of the tornado tracked closer to the Haile community, crossing Highway 143, Jordan Taunton Road, Sunset Road, Haile Baptist Church Road, and Jessie Guinn Road. In these areas, the damage was again confined to mainly snapped and uprooted trees, with several homes and outbuildings heavily damaged, but mainly due to downed trees. The tornado was unique in a few ways. First, the path width was up to a half a mile in the latter portion of the track, which is very wide for a tornado which was mostly weak throughout a majority of its path. Secondly, the collapsing of the large electrical transmission towers garnered a rating up to 130 mph, but there were no other surveyed damage indicators which warranted an EF-2 rating. The survey team believes there could be other significant damage indicators near the downed transmission towers, although potentially live downed high voltage lines in the vicinity of the towers did not allow the survey team to survey in close proximity."

The most significant structural damage was observed as the tornado crossed Emma Drive west of Parkers Chapel Road. Here, two double-wide manufactured homes were partially shifted off their cinder blocks but remained intact with no other damage. Two outbuildings were also destroyed. One outbuilding was small and entirely made out of wood, but its 2x4 vertical support boards were driven 3 feet into the ground during construction and mostly remained in place. The other outbuilding was much larger and consisted of a metal roof and frame, which was twisted to a great degree. The expected wind speeds for these two outbuildings and their degree of damage were in the low EF-2 range. However, given the all-wood construction of the first building and its support beams remaining partially buried, and a distinct lack of widespread tree damage in the immediate vicinity, the estimated wind speeds were lowered, resulting in an EF-1 rating, which was also more consistent with the vast majority of the damage observed. ||The tornado continued northeast across Parkers Chapel Road and through a couple of neighborhoods south and east of Parkers Chapel School. Widespread snapping and uprooting of large softwood pine trees occurred in this area. Structural damage in this area was caused by the falling trees rather than the tornado itself. One uprooted tree fell through a single-wide manufactured home occupied by three people when the tornado struck. Fortunately, no injuries occurred in this home. ||More snapped and uprooted softwood trees were observed as the tornado crossed Lynn Drive, Evans Drive, Ables Drive, Rilla Street, Oleta Avenue, Wotapi Street, and Highway 15. The tornado began to weaken as it continued northeast out of the Parkers Chapel community but snapped another softwood tree north of Buchanan Road east of Highway 15 before finally lifting near the intersection of Highway 15/Highway 82 on the southwest side of El Dorado."

Looking at post in the ground the mud was soft and waterlogged so it likely did not take as much force to destroy the building so a lower wind estimate was used at 80 mph. ||To the west along City Hill Road there were several medium to large pines that had |either been snapped or uprooted also in a 155 to 160 degree direction. Many of the uprooted trees had a shallow root ball and the hole left by the root ball in the ground was filled with water. To the north along Ridge Road, power poles were either tilting or snapped. The power poles were thinner and older so a lower wind estimate was used resulting in the 85 mph rating. ||Multiple pine trees were also snapped or uprooted at several homes along Ridge Road as well, falling in the 155 to 160 degree direction as well. One home had a chimney that toppled over. Talking to a couple home owners that were home at the time of the |microburst, the stories matched up with strong winds and heavy rain occurring at the same time resulting in white out conditions similar to a blizzard. The stories as well as all the damage and fallen trees leaning in the same direction away from the core of |the storm on radar at the time of the damage means that this was likely a microburst.

A tree was blown down onto and blocked County Line Road, and some trees were blown down in the parking lot of the Renaissance at Colony Park near the beginning of the swath. Intermittent damage to trees was noted apart from the swath, but a more significant corridor of damage across southern and central Madison County was consistent with downburst winds estimated winds at 75 to 85 mph. The main part of the downburst event appears to have originated in the vicinity of Bruce Campbell Field in Madison where minor damage was observed to awnings and gutters at a church on Ridgecrest Drive. Tree falls and overall impacts were maximized just north of the airfield in the vicinity of Strawberry Patch Park and adjacent areas near Hoy and St. Augustine Roads. Numerous trees were downed generally from south to north, and some minor damage to sheet metal awnings, carports, and shingles occurred. In this vicinity, several homes, outbuildings, and power poles and lines sustained damage from falling trees. It is this area where winds were estimated to be the strongest - around 75 mph. To the south and east, tree falls were generally west to east with relatively minor structural impact and decreasing tree fall density. Only downed large branches were noted along the Natchez Trace two miles southwest of the Highway 43 intersection. To the north, tree falls remained generally south to north with similar reductions in frequency and severity of vegetative damage with northward extent. Most notably, areas north of the Quail Hollow and Clarkdale Road vicinity saw increasingly isolated instances of damage. Areas where fencing was oriented perpendicular to the gusty southerly winds were damaged as far north as eastern portions of Gluckstadt. The length of this damage swath was around ten miles long and four miles wide."

It then continued northeast, just north of Highway 243, before crossing Highway 218 and Nebo Rd, where widespread tree damage occurred. Some areas beyond this were inaccessible due to fallen trees. Satellite imagery indicates potential EF2 to EF3 tree damage in the nearby wooded area. The tornado crossed CR 144, CR 163, CR 211, Good Hope Rd and Spring Lake Rd between Burkhead Lake, Spring Lake and Water Lake. In this area, the tornado was an estimated one half to three quarters of a mile wide and caused EF2 to EF3 tree damage to the forested areas. Some damage was noted to structures along these inaccessible areas. It then crossed Enon Rd, where damage was noted to a home, and Highway 35, where widespread tree damage, major roof, and minor siding damage occurred to a mobile home. One mobile home just north of Highway 35 was thrown off the blocks and into a nearby wooded area some 50 yards away. In this location, 3 fatalities occurred. An 18 wheeler tractor trailer was also blown over on the side. Just to the northeast, satellite imagery indicates a structure had major damage, with the majority of it destroyed. The tornado then crossed CR 278 and CR 61, with minor tree damage, but the majority of the more intense tree damage as viewed within satellite imagery occurred in inaccessible areas just to the north. It then crossed Gum Branch Rd before crossing Interstate 55, where ground surveys and satellite imagery indicated the tornado was nearly a half mile wide. The tornado then crossed Highway 51, Stafford Wells Rd and Highway 407, where major roof damage occurred to residential homes consistent with EF2 intensity. The tornado then crossed Highway 82, where numerous power lines were downed, causing high end EF1 to low end EF2 damage. The tornado then crossed the intersection of Bethlehem Community Rd and Bethlehem Church Rd, where EF2 damage occurred. Three outbuildings were destroyed. A home had major roof damage, and another structure moved off the foundation. The tornado then crossed Hammond Rd, causing major tree damage in the wooded areas. The tornado then caused low end EF2 damage just south of Robinson-Thompson Rd, where an outbuilding was destroyed and a nearby 100 year old home had minor to moderate roof and siding damage but was left standing. The tornado lifted as it crossed Robinson-Thompson Rd. The maximum estimated wind gusts in Carroll County were 165 mph. The total path length was 29.57 miles across the two counties."

It then |proceeded to near the village of Calvert, just east of Chandlee Road and its intersection with Telegraph Road/MD-273 where three wooden power poles were snapped. The tornado continued to move east along Telegraph Road and caused uprooted and snapped hardwood and softwood trees near Rosebank United Methodist Church. The tornado then moved to the southeast and resulted in extensive tree and minor  structural damage in the vicinity of Calvert Regional Park, Cecil Arena, and Rising Sun High School. Over 100 trees were damaged in this area with numerous softwood and hardwood trees being uprooted and snapped. The area was littered with small tree debris. Damage to fencing was observed along with shingles being removed, soffit, fascia, and siding damaged, and other minor structural damage to homes and businesses. At the Calvert Regional Park, portable toilets were broken into several smaller parts and moved more than 300 yards into fields to the north of the storm's track.

Shortly after crossing Zeke Road while moving in an east-northeasterly direction, the tornado reached its peak estimated wind speed near 104 mph as the NWS survey team found numerous snapped softwood trees on a heavily wooded property. The tornado continued a consistent movement to the east-northeast for another quarter mile, before turning sharply to the southeast and crossing back over Highway 154. This rather atypical tornadic movement was represented quite closely in the associated radar data. Many trees were uprooted and a few were snapped as the tornado crossed Highway 154 and the team was not able to survey more damage from the ground due to lack of road access until the tornado next crossed Highway 4 near the intersection of Highway 4 and PR 537. The tornado also uprooted numerous hardwood and softwood trees here, while also snapping a few softwoods. It is possible that the tornado continued a bit farther than the endpoint represented in the survey, but the NWS survey team could not confirm this due to the lack of ground access immediately to the southeast. An overwhelming majority of the damage in this tornado was limited to trees, although throughout the path, there were a handfull of residences and structures damaged by falling trees and downed limbs. Pictures were also submitted of a funnel cloud to the west of this surveyed tornado and east of Lake Bistineau. While it is possible there was another tornado touchdown a little west of this tornado, the survey team did not have any ground access to conduct a survey in this area."

The supercell spawned a quick spin-up tornado that struck the town of Laguna Heights, Texas, over a two-minute period before the circulation moved over Laguna Madre Bay and rapidly dissipated. The tornado tracked to the east-northeast after the circulation was impacted by the approaching squall line, creating a boomerang effect since the original motion of the radar couplet was to the north-northwest prior to touchdown. Winds may have reached 110 mph, the top of the EF1 scale, in a few locations ��� but the very poor quality of construction suggests 105 mph is a better estimate.||The strongest portion of the tornado, rated EF1, flattened at least six poorly built mobile home structures, removed part of the second story of a local business, and removed the majority of roof decking on at least ten other residences and buildings. At least a half dozen ash and mesquite trees were snapped or uprooted and two wooden power poles were bent. Casualties were found in several of the demolished mobile homes. A man in his forties was killed when the home collapsed on him. Five others were injured in the same cluster of damaged homes, and two more were injured in a flattened mobile home near the shoreline of Laguna Madre Bay. Two of the injuries, in the home along the bayfront, required extended hospitalizations. Thirty-eight additional residents were displaced by the tornado and were housed at the local events center with American Red Cross assistance. In all, there was the one fatality and eleven injuries, of which two were critical head injuries. Surrounding the EF1 area, portions of roofs and shingles were removed from residences, large limbs were broken, and fences were knocked down."

2023,March,24,2023-03-24 18:57:00,18:57:00,30000.0,Tornado,MISSISSIPPI,EF1,MAYERSVILLE,32.84,-91.0,"This long track, violent tornado began over northern |Issaquena County near Grant Rd, downing multiple trees and damaging |two older outbuildings. It tracked northeastward, producing tree |damage as it crossed the Steele Bayou Canal before crossing into |Sharkey County. At this point, the tornado began to substantially |increase in size and intensity. A very high percentage of trees were |snapped along the path through a wooded area south of Bear Lake Rd. |It was in this wooded area where the first indications of EF3 to EF4 |damage were noted, with at least one tree and root ball and several |more large tree pieces fully displaced into the downstream field. |From this point along the path in Sharkey County, there was a well |defined confluence zone in damage along the center of the tornado |track. ||On the western outskirts of the city of Rolling Fork, homes began to |be impacted with significant roof damage along Bear Lake Rd. Several |tall wooden utility transmission poles were snapped along Bear |Lake Rd and MS Highway 826. Along Pinkins Rd, each structure along|the road, including several manufactured homes and two site built|homes, was demolished. Structures on the west end of the road |were scattered radially southeastward, and structures on the east |end of the road were scattered northward. An occupant of one of |the mobile homes was critically injured during the tornado and |eventually passed away nearly four weeks later. Debarking was |observed on several hardwood trees, with only stubs of the main |branches of some trees remaining. Crossing MS 826 and along |Fleetwood Rd, an older metal building was swept away, a small home|was destroyed and numerous manufactured homes were destroyed. ||As the tornado moved into the western side of Rolling Fork, the |tornadic wind field was broad, encompassing the area from Race St, |where exterior damage occurred to the Sharkey Issaquena Hospital, to |Bear Lake Rd on the south end where several utility poles were |snapped. The corridor of greatest damage on the west side of the |city, rated high end EF3, extended from 7th St between Martin Ave |and Joor Ave to 3rd St between Southern Ave and Lewis Ave. In this |area, multiple homes lost most exterior walls, several more lost |roofs and some walls, and even more received at least minor damage. |Two fatalities occurred along 7th St when a trailer truck was tossed |into a home. Through this corridor, additional debarking of trees |was noted near the center of the path. Brief and minor weakening |occurred as the tornado moved east of 3rd St and began to approach |Deer Creek, with EF2 damage still common. Along the creek, the |fire station, Rolling Fork Elementary School, and South Delta High|School all sustained roof and other exterior damage.||After the tornado crossed Deer Creek and began to move into the |downtown area of Rolling Fork, reintensification occurred. |Additional EF4 damage was noted in the block between Sharkey St and |Worthington Ave and north of Collette Ave where a home and a duplex |apartment were entirely demolished, with the foundation of the |duplex partially swept. Large metal buildings at an agriculture |business at the intersection of East St and West Ave were destroyed. |A fatality occurred when a mobile home along Worthington Ave was |destroyed. On Parkway Ave, a Masonic lodge was leveled and a gas |station was substantially damaged. ||The tornado then crossed Rolling Fork Creek, damaging and destroying |several structures along McLaurin St and China St. A water tower |east of Hicks Ave, which was in service at the time of the tornado, |was felled in a southeastward direction, perpendicular to the |tornado path. In the downtown area, the roof was removed from the |Rolling Fork US Post Office, portions of Rolling Fork City Hall, and |portions of the Rolling Fork Police Department. The Sharkey County |Courthouse received damage to the roof and some windows, with the |cupola removed. Additional EF4 damage was observed as the tornado |crossed Walnut St, with multiple homes and businesses having all or |most walls downed. One building in this corridor was compromised by |two tossed tractor trailers and another was compromised by a |southward facing metal door. A fatality occurred when a mobile home |off Sidney Alexander St north of Walnut St was destroyed.||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it approached US Highway |61 just north of Walnut St. Multiple brick homes along Mulberry St |were leveled, with debris remaining on the foundations. A discount |retail chain store was completely destroyed, with much of the debris |swept to the downstream side of the foundation and rowed along the |tornado path. Two people died at this location. A gift/floral shop |was destroyed, with most debris swept from the foundation. |Additional businesses, including a lumber/hardware store, two |restaurants, a furniture store, and an insurance agency were also |destroyed in this area. One occupant of a truck traveling along US |61 was killed when the tornado tossed his vehicle from the highway |to near the lumber/hardware store. A mobile/manufactured home park |on the east side of US 61 was devastated, with all 30-35 homes |destroyed. Considerable debris from these homes was rowed 300-400|yards downstream along the tornado path into an adjacent field |and stand of trees. Six occupants of these homes died in the |tornado.||The tornado remained strong to violent as it continued northeast of |Rolling Fork across mainly open fields. Through these fields, aerial |imagery revealed multiple areas of ground scarring. The tornado |crossed Matthews Rd near a catfish farm, where several utility poles |were snapped near the ground and covered in 1 to 2 inches of mud. |Some of the poles were tossed into nearby ponds. Prolific tree |damage occurred along Sandy Bayou, with a few buildings along the |outer edges of the path damaged and a tractor trailer flipped. |Another area of EF4 damage was observed from Widow Bayou and E River |Rd northeastward through Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd. Through this |corridor, extraordinary hardwood tree damage occurred with most |trees completely mangled and debarking noted. There was additional |evidence of trees or large parts of trees being tossed or dragged a |short distance. Several utility poles were snapped, with some tossed |a short distance. An outbuilding type structure off Dogwood Rd was |blown away, with a school bus from the property tossed into nearby |trees. Ground scarring and cycloidal marks were observed in the |field between Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd, along with mulched tree |debris which was rowed into a narrow line along the center of the |tornado path. Tree damage continued across Keith Rd and Charlie Pitt |Rd as the tornado approached MS Highway 14.||East of Anguilla along MS Highway 14, a frame home was completely|destroyed. Near the home, several power poles were snapped or |broken. Tree damage was extensive with large areas mowed down. A |tenth of a mile east, a mobile home was rolled into nearby trees. |Moving into Humphreys County, along Prudent Rd, most of the roof |was taken off of a home, where the garage collapsed along with a |portion of the front porch. One vehicle was flipped and another |was moved. A metal workshop was destroyed and structural beams |were bent. Along the road, several power poles were snapped and |thrown a couple hundred feet into a nearby field. As the tornado |approached and crossed Seven Mile Rd, intensity increased. Here, |several metal buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed with |structural beams bent. Grain bins had sides collapsed and the tops|blown off. A small brick home was completely destroyed with all |of the exterior walls collapsed. The home next door had a large |portion of the roof removed and part of a wall had collapsed. |Debris from the home was thrown several hundred feet into a nearby|field. Vehicles were moved out of the garage and a large grain |storage cart was thrown into the field as well. ||For several miles, the tornado traveled along MS Highway 149 |moving toward Silver City where large areas of hardwood trees were|snapped and uprooted. Multiple center pivot irrigation systems |were flipped. A mobile home was completely destroyed when it was |rolled into a nearby field. A portion of the roof was blown off a |school. A community along the same road had several homes with |significant roof damage, and at least one home had decking |material partially removed. Several homes and a large metal |building were severely damaged when portions of the roof were |blown off. A second metal building was completely destroyed with |large structural posts bent. ||As the tornado came into Silver City from the west along Highway |149, an apartment complex was heavily damaged. Several buildings |had sections of the roof removed and one building had portions of |the western walls partially collapsed. A fatality occurred in one|of the single story apartment buildings. In the nearby |neighborhood, numerous homes had roof damage. At least two frame |homes were destroyed where one or more exterior walls collapsed. A|large number of old hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. As |the storm moved east toward US 49W, more trees were snapped and |uprooted. Several homes and a church near the intersection of |MS Highway 14 and US 49W had areas of the roof damaged or |removed. Four mobile homes were completely destroyed. One person |died when a mobile home was tossed into a house, and a child died|in one of the mobile homes that was destroyed. Numerous trees |were snapped and uprooted, a few of which fell on homes. The |rating in the Silver City area ranged from EF1-EF2. ||The tornado continued to track east where mostly tree damage |occurred. In rural portions of Holmes County northeast of Tchula, |there was substantial tree damage with swaths of snapped and |uprooted trees. Several center pivot irrigation systems were |overturned and grain bins were flipped or destroyed. The tornado |continued to move northeast before dissipating in a wooded area |north of Randall Road. The maximum estimated wind gusts in Issaquena County were 95 mph. The total path length was 59.35 miles across the four counties. An estimated 165 injuries were caused by this tornado, including 150 in Sharkey County and 15 in Humphreys County."

Shortly after forming, the storm became severe and started to rotate. The storm went on to produce an EF-2 tornado, touching down near the Cypress Creek Oil Field to the north of Moro Bay Highway near Stowe Ditch Road. At this location, there were numerous trees either snapped or uprooted from winds around 80 to 85 mph. As the tornado tracked to the southeast towards Moro Bay Highway, it strengthened some which was evident from the more widespread tree damage. As it crossed Moro Bay Highway, it did not cause any major damage to structures despite there being some along the path. From there,|the road network became sparse, but some additional tree damage was observed along Feldmann Road to the southeast of Moro Bay Highway. ||From there, the tornado continued to track southeast, causing significant damage along Pigeon Hill Road. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved toward New London Road. This is where the greatest destruction was observed as the tornado moved over|a chicken farm and five chicken coops. Three of the five chicken coops were completely destroyed with additional damage to a few other barns and outbuildings. With the amount of tree damage surrounding the chicken coops, along with the total destruction of three of them, the tornado was rated EF-2 with maximum winds at 115 mph. This damage was short-lived and confined to this farm on the west and east side of New London Road. Additionally, there was a tree that fell on a manufactured home just to the north of the farm. The owners of the farm who lived in a brick home were able to call the family in the manufactured home after getting the tornado warning and had them rush to their house. So no one was in the the manufactured home when it took on damage. From there, the tornado continued to track to the southeast with more significant tree damage off Christian Road and North Road to the north of Phelps Road before lifting."

It tracked northeastward, producing tree |damage as it crossed the Steele Bayou Canal before crossing into |Sharkey County. At this point, the tornado began to substantially |increase in size and intensity. A very high percentage of trees were |snapped along the path through a wooded area south of Bear Lake Rd. |It was in this wooded area where the first indications of EF3 to EF4 |damage were noted, with at least one tree and root ball and several |more large tree pieces fully displaced into the downstream field. |From this point along the path in Sharkey County, there was a well |defined confluence zone in damage along the center of the tornado |track. ||On the western outskirts of the city of Rolling Fork, homes began to |be impacted with significant roof damage along Bear Lake Rd. Several |tall wooden utility transmission poles were snapped along Bear |Lake Rd and MS Highway 826. Along Pinkins Rd, each structure along|the road, including several manufactured homes and two site built|homes, was demolished. Structures on the west end of the road |were scattered radially southeastward, and structures on the east |end of the road were scattered northward. An occupant of one of |the mobile homes was critically injured during the tornado and |eventually passed away nearly four weeks later. Debarking was |observed on several hardwood trees, with only stubs of the main |branches of some trees remaining. Crossing MS 826 and along |Fleetwood Rd, an older metal building was swept away, a small home|was destroyed and numerous manufactured homes were destroyed. ||As the tornado moved into the western side of Rolling Fork, the |tornadic wind field was broad, encompassing the area from Race St, |where exterior damage occurred to the Sharkey Issaquena Hospital, to |Bear Lake Rd on the south end where several utility poles were |snapped. The corridor of greatest damage on the west side of the |city, rated high end EF3, extended from 7th St between Martin Ave |and Joor Ave to 3rd St between Southern Ave and Lewis Ave. In this |area, multiple homes lost most exterior walls, several more lost |roofs and some walls, and even more received at least minor damage. |Two fatalities occurred along 7th St when a trailer truck was tossed |into a home. Through this corridor, additional debarking of trees |was noted near the center of the path. Brief and minor weakening |occurred as the tornado moved east of 3rd St and began to approach |Deer Creek, with EF2 damage still common. Along the creek, the |fire station, Rolling Fork Elementary School, and South Delta High|School all sustained roof and other exterior damage.||After the tornado crossed Deer Creek and began to move into the |downtown area of Rolling Fork, reintensification occurred. |Additional EF4 damage was noted in the block between Sharkey St and |Worthington Ave and north of Collette Ave where a home and a duplex |apartment were entirely demolished, with the foundation of the |duplex partially swept. Large metal buildings at an agriculture |business at the intersection of East St and West Ave were destroyed. |A fatality occurred when a mobile home along Worthington Ave was |destroyed. On Parkway Ave, a Masonic lodge was leveled and a gas |station was substantially damaged. ||The tornado then crossed Rolling Fork Creek, damaging and destroying |several structures along McLaurin St and China St. A water tower |east of Hicks Ave, which was in service at the time of the tornado, |was felled in a southeastward direction, perpendicular to the |tornado path. In the downtown area, the roof was removed from the |Rolling Fork US Post Office, portions of Rolling Fork City Hall, and |portions of the Rolling Fork Police Department. The Sharkey County |Courthouse received damage to the roof and some windows, with the |cupola removed. Additional EF4 damage was observed as the tornado |crossed Walnut St, with multiple homes and businesses having all or |most walls downed. One building in this corridor was compromised by |two tossed tractor trailers and another was compromised by a |southward facing metal door. A fatality occurred when a mobile home |off Sidney Alexander St north of Walnut St was destroyed.||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it approached US Highway |61 just north of Walnut St. Multiple brick homes along Mulberry St |were leveled, with debris remaining on the foundations. A discount |retail chain store was completely destroyed, with much of the debris |swept to the downstream side of the foundation and rowed along the |tornado path. Two people died at this location. A gift/floral shop |was destroyed, with most debris swept from the foundation. |Additional businesses, including a lumber/hardware store, two |restaurants, a furniture store, and an insurance agency were also |destroyed in this area. One occupant of a truck traveling along US |61 was killed when the tornado tossed his vehicle from the highway |to near the lumber/hardware store. A mobile/manufactured home park |on the east side of US 61 was devastated, with all 30-35 homes |destroyed. Considerable debris from these homes was rowed 300-400|yards downstream along the tornado path into an adjacent field |and stand of trees. Six occupants of these homes died in the |tornado.||The tornado remained strong to violent as it continued northeast of |Rolling Fork across mainly open fields. Through these fields, aerial |imagery revealed multiple areas of ground scarring. The tornado |crossed Matthews Rd near a catfish farm, where several utility poles |were snapped near the ground and covered in 1 to 2 inches of mud. |Some of the poles were tossed into nearby ponds. Prolific tree |damage occurred along Sandy Bayou, with a few buildings along the |outer edges of the path damaged and a tractor trailer flipped. |Another area of EF4 damage was observed from Widow Bayou and E River |Rd northeastward through Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd. Through this |corridor, extraordinary hardwood tree damage occurred with most |trees completely mangled and debarking noted. There was additional |evidence of trees or large parts of trees being tossed or dragged a |short distance. Several utility poles were snapped, with some tossed |a short distance. An outbuilding type structure off Dogwood Rd was |blown away, with a school bus from the property tossed into nearby |trees. Ground scarring and cycloidal marks were observed in the |field between Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd, along with mulched tree |debris which was rowed into a narrow line along the center of the |tornado path. Tree damage continued across Keith Rd and Charlie Pitt |Rd as the tornado approached MS Highway 14.||East of Anguilla along MS Highway 14, a frame home was completely|destroyed. Near the home, several power poles were snapped or |broken. Tree damage was extensive with large areas mowed down. A |tenth of a mile east, a mobile home was rolled into nearby trees. |Moving into Humphreys County, along Prudent Rd, most of the roof |was taken off of a home, where the garage collapsed along with a |portion of the front porch. One vehicle was flipped and another |was moved. A metal workshop was destroyed and structural beams |were bent. Along the road, several power poles were snapped and |thrown a couple hundred feet into a nearby field. As the tornado |approached and crossed Seven Mile Rd, intensity increased. Here, |several metal buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed with |structural beams bent. Grain bins had sides collapsed and the tops|blown off. A small brick home was completely destroyed with all |of the exterior walls collapsed. The home next door had a large |portion of the roof removed and part of a wall had collapsed. |Debris from the home was thrown several hundred feet into a nearby|field. Vehicles were moved out of the garage and a large grain |storage cart was thrown into the field as well. ||For several miles, the tornado traveled along MS Highway 149 |moving toward Silver City where large areas of hardwood trees were|snapped and uprooted. Multiple center pivot irrigation systems |were flipped. A mobile home was completely destroyed when it was |rolled into a nearby field. A portion of the roof was blown off a |school. A community along the same road had several homes with |significant roof damage, and at least one home had decking |material partially removed. Several homes and a large metal |building were severely damaged when portions of the roof were |blown off. A second metal building was completely destroyed with |large structural posts bent. ||As the tornado came into Silver City from the west along Highway |149, an apartment complex was heavily damaged. Several buildings |had sections of the roof removed and one building had portions of |the western walls partially collapsed. A fatality occurred in one|of the single story apartment buildings. In the nearby |neighborhood, numerous homes had roof damage. At least two frame |homes were destroyed where one or more exterior walls collapsed. A|large number of old hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. As |the storm moved east toward US 49W, more trees were snapped and |uprooted. Several homes and a church near the intersection of |MS Highway 14 and US 49W had areas of the roof damaged or |removed. Four mobile homes were completely destroyed. One person |died when a mobile home was tossed into a house, and a child died|in one of the mobile homes that was destroyed. Numerous trees |were snapped and uprooted, a few of which fell on homes. The |rating in the Silver City area ranged from EF1-EF2. ||The tornado continued to track east where mostly tree damage |occurred. In rural portions of Holmes County northeast of Tchula, |there was substantial tree damage with swaths of snapped and |uprooted trees. Several center pivot irrigation systems were |overturned and grain bins were flipped or destroyed. The tornado |continued to move northeast before dissipating in a wooded area |north of Randall Road. The maximum estimated wind gusts in Sharkey County were 195 mph. The total path length was 59.35 miles across the four counties. An estimated 165 injuries were caused by this tornado, including 150 in Sharkey County and 15 in Humphreys County."

It tracked northeastward, producing tree damage as it crossed the Steele Bayou Canal before crossing into Sharkey County. At this point, the tornado began to substantially increase in size and intensity. A very high percentage of trees were snapped along the path through a wooded area south of Bear Lake Rd. It was in this wooded area where the first indications of EF3 to EF4 damage were noted, with at least one tree and root ball and several more large tree pieces fully displaced into the downstream field. From this point along the path in Sharkey County, there was a well defined confluence zone in damage along the center of the tornado track. On the western outskirts of the city of Rolling Fork, homes began to be impacted with significant roof damage along Bear Lake Rd. Several tall wooden utility transmission poles were snapped along Bear Lake Rd and MS Highway 826. Along Pinkins Rd, each structure along the road, including several manufactured homes and two site built homes, was demolished. Structures on the west end of the road were scattered radially southeastward, and structures on the east end of the road were scattered northward. An occupant of one of the mobile homes was critically injured during the tornado and eventually passed away nearly four weeks later. Debarking was observed on several hardwood trees, with only stubs of the main branches of some trees remaining. Crossing MS 826 and along Fleetwood Rd, an older metal building was swept away, a small home was destroyed and numerous manufactured homes were destroyed. As the tornado moved into the western side of Rolling Fork, the tornadic wind field was broad, encompassing the area from Race St, where exterior damage occurred to the Sharkey Issaquena Hospital, to Bear Lake Rd on the south end where several utility poles were snapped. The corridor of greatest damage on the west side of the city, rated high end EF3, extended from 7th St between Martin Ave and Joor Ave to 3rd St between Southern Ave and Lewis Ave. In this area, multiple homes lost most exterior walls, several more lost roofs and some walls, and even more received at least minor damage. Two fatalities occurred along 7th St when a trailer truck was tossed into a home. Through this corridor, additional debarking of trees was noted near the center of the path. Brief and minor weakening occurred as the tornado moved east of 3rd St and began to approach Deer Creek, with EF2 damage still common. Along the creek, the fire station, Rolling Fork Elementary School, and South Delta High School all sustained roof and other exterior damage. After the tornado crossed Deer Creek and began to move into the downtown area of Rolling Fork, reintensification occurred. Additional EF4 damage was noted in the block between Sharkey St and Worthington Ave and north of Collette Ave where a home and a duplex apartment were entirely demolished, with the foundation of the duplex partially swept. Large metal buildings at an agriculture business at the intersection of East St and West Ave were destroyed. A fatality occurred when a mobile home along Worthington Ave was destroyed. On Parkway Ave, a Masonic lodge was leveled and a gas station was substantially damaged. The tornado then crossed Rolling Fork Creek, damaging and destroying several structures along McLaurin St and China St. A water tower east of Hicks Ave, which was in service at the time of the tornado, was felled in a southeastward direction, perpendicular to the tornado path. In the downtown area, the roof was removed from the Rolling Fork US Post Office, portions of Rolling Fork City Hall, and portions of the Rolling Fork Police Department. The Sharkey County Courthouse received damage to the roof and some windows, with the cupola removed. Additional EF4 damage was observed as the tornado crossed Walnut St, with multiple homes and businesses having all or most walls downed. One building in this corridor was compromised by two tossed tractor trailers and another was compromised by a southward facing metal door. A fatality occurred when a mobile home off Sidney Alexander St north of Walnut St was destroyed. The tornado reached its peak intensity as it approached US Highway 61 just north of Walnut St. Multiple brick homes along Mulberry St were leveled, with debris remaining on the foundations. A discount retail chain store was completely destroyed, with much of the debris swept to the downstream side of the foundation and rowed along the tornado path. Two people died at this location. A gift/floral shop was destroyed, with most debris swept from the foundation. Additional businesses, including a lumber/hardware store, two restaurants, a furniture store, and an insurance agency were also destroyed in this area. One occupant of a truck traveling along US 61 was killed when the tornado tossed his vehicle from the highway to near the lumber/hardware store. A mobile/manufactured home park on the east side of US 61 was devastated, with all 30-35 homes destroyed. Considerable debris from these homes was rowed 300-400 yards downstream along the tornado path into an adjacent field and stand of trees. Six occupants of these homes died in the tornado. The tornado remained strong to violent as it continued northeast of Rolling Fork across mainly open fields. Through these fields, aerial imagery revealed multiple areas of ground scarring. The tornado crossed Matthews Rd near a catfish farm, where several utility poles were snapped near the ground and covered in 1 to 2 inches of mud. Some of the poles were tossed into nearby ponds. Prolific tree damage occurred along Sandy Bayou, with a few buildings along the outer edges of the path damaged and a tractor trailer flipped. Another area of EF4 damage was observed from Widow Bayou and E River Rd northeastward through Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd. Through this corridor, extraordinary hardwood tree damage occurred with most trees completely mangled and debarking noted. There was additional evidence of trees or large parts of trees being tossed or dragged a short distance. Several utility poles were snapped, with some tossed a short distance. An outbuilding type structure off Dogwood Rd was blown away, with a school bus from the property tossed into nearby trees. Ground scarring and cycloidal marks were observed in the field between Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd, along with mulched tree debris which was rowed into a narrow line along the center of the tornado path. Tree damage continued across Keith Rd and Charlie Pitt Rd as the tornado approached MS Highway 14. East of Anguilla along MS Highway 14, a frame home was completely destroyed. Near the home, several power poles were snapped or broken. Tree damage was extensive with large areas mowed down. A tenth of a mile east, a mobile home was rolled into nearby trees. Moving into Humphreys County, along Prudent Rd, most of the roof was taken off of a home, where the garage collapsed along with a portion of the front porch. One vehicle was flipped and another was moved. A metal workshop was destroyed and structural beams were bent. Along the road, several power poles were snapped and thrown a couple hundred feet into a nearby field. As the tornado approached and crossed Seven Mile Rd, intensity increased. Here, several metal buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed with structural beams bent. Grain bins had sides collapsed and the tops blown off. A small brick home was completely destroyed with all of the exterior walls collapsed. The home next door had a large portion of the roof removed and part of a wall had collapsed. Debris from the home was thrown several hundred feet into a nearby field. Vehicles were moved out of the garage and a large grain storage cart was thrown into the field as well. For several miles, the tornado traveled along MS Highway 149 moving toward Silver City where large areas of hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted. Multiple center pivot irrigation systems were flipped. A mobile home was completely destroyed when it was rolled into a nearby field. A portion of the roof was blown off a school. A community along the same road had several homes with significant roof damage, and at least one home had decking material partially removed. Several homes and a large metal building were severely damaged when portions of the roof were blown off. A second metal building was completely destroyed with large structural posts bent. As the tornado came into Silver City from the west along Highway 149, an apartment complex was heavily damaged. Several buildings had sections of the roof removed and one building had portions of the western walls partially collapsed. A fatality occurred in one of the single story apartment buildings. In the nearby neighborhood, numerous homes had roof damage. At least two frame homes were destroyed where one or more exterior walls collapsed. A large number of old hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. As the storm moved east toward US 49W, more trees were snapped and uprooted. Several homes and a church near the intersection of MS Highway 14 and US 49W had areas of the roof damaged or removed. Four mobile homes were completely destroyed. One person died when a mobile home was tossed into a house, and a child died in one of the mobile homes that was destroyed. Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted, a few of which fell on homes. The rating in the Silver City area ranged from EF1-EF2. The tornado continued to track east where mostly tree damage occurred. In rural portions of Holmes County northeast of Tchula, there was substantial tree damage with swaths of snapped and uprooted trees. Several center pivot irrigation systems were overturned and grain bins were flipped or destroyed. The tornado continued to move northeast before dissipating in a wooded area north of Randall Road. The maximum estimated wind gusts in Humphreys County were 160 mph. The total path length was 59.35 miles across the four counties. An estimated 165 injuries were caused by this tornado, including 150 in Sharkey County and 15 in Humphreys County."

It tracked northeastward, producing tree |damage as it crossed the Steele Bayou Canal before crossing into |Sharkey County. At this point, the tornado began to substantially |increase in size and intensity. A very high percentage of trees were |snapped along the path through a wooded area south of Bear Lake Rd. |It was in this wooded area where the first indications of EF3 to EF4 |damage were noted, with at least one tree and root ball and several |more large tree pieces fully displaced into the downstream field. |From this point along the path in Sharkey County, there was a well |defined confluence zone in damage along the center of the tornado |track. ||On the western outskirts of the city of Rolling Fork, homes began to |be impacted with significant roof damage along Bear Lake Rd. Several |tall wooden utility transmission poles were snapped along Bear |Lake Rd and MS Highway 826. Along Pinkins Rd, each structure along|the road, including several manufactured homes and two site built|homes, was demolished. Structures on the west end of the road |were scattered radially southeastward, and structures on the east |end of the road were scattered northward. An occupant of one of |the mobile homes was critically injured during the tornado and |eventually passed away nearly four weeks later. Debarking was |observed on several hardwood trees, with only stubs of the main |branches of some trees remaining. Crossing MS 826 and along |Fleetwood Rd, an older metal building was swept away, a small home|was destroyed and numerous manufactured homes were destroyed. ||As the tornado moved into the western side of Rolling Fork, the |tornadic wind field was broad, encompassing the area from Race St, |where exterior damage occurred to the Sharkey Issaquena Hospital, to |Bear Lake Rd on the south end where several utility poles were |snapped. The corridor of greatest damage on the west side of the |city, rated high end EF3, extended from 7th St between Martin Ave |and Joor Ave to 3rd St between Southern Ave and Lewis Ave. In this |area, multiple homes lost most exterior walls, several more lost |roofs and some walls, and even more received at least minor damage. |Two fatalities occurred along 7th St when a trailer truck was tossed |into a home. Through this corridor, additional debarking of trees |was noted near the center of the path. Brief and minor weakening |occurred as the tornado moved east of 3rd St and began to approach |Deer Creek, with EF2 damage still common. Along the creek, the |fire station, Rolling Fork Elementary School, and South Delta High|School all sustained roof and other exterior damage.||After the tornado crossed Deer Creek and began to move into the |downtown area of Rolling Fork, reintensification occurred. |Additional EF4 damage was noted in the block between Sharkey St and |Worthington Ave and north of Collette Ave where a home and a duplex |apartment were entirely demolished, with the foundation of the |duplex partially swept. Large metal buildings at an agriculture |business at the intersection of East St and West Ave were destroyed. |A fatality occurred when a mobile home along Worthington Ave was |destroyed. On Parkway Ave, a Masonic lodge was leveled and a gas |station was substantially damaged. ||The tornado then crossed Rolling Fork Creek, damaging and destroying |several structures along McLaurin St and China St. A water tower |east of Hicks Ave, which was in service at the time of the tornado, |was felled in a southeastward direction, perpendicular to the |tornado path. In the downtown area, the roof was removed from the |Rolling Fork US Post Office, portions of Rolling Fork City Hall, and |portions of the Rolling Fork Police Department. The Sharkey County |Courthouse received damage to the roof and some windows, with the |cupola removed. Additional EF4 damage was observed as the tornado |crossed Walnut St, with multiple homes and businesses having all or |most walls downed. One building in this corridor was compromised by |two tossed tractor trailers and another was compromised by a |southward facing metal door. A fatality occurred when a mobile home |off Sidney Alexander St north of Walnut St was destroyed.||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it approached US Highway |61 just north of Walnut St. Multiple brick homes along Mulberry St |were leveled, with debris remaining on the foundations. A discount |retail chain store was completely destroyed, with much of the debris |swept to the downstream side of the foundation and rowed along the |tornado path. Two people died at this location. A gift/floral shop |was destroyed, with most debris swept from the foundation. |Additional businesses, including a lumber/hardware store, two |restaurants, a furniture store, and an insurance agency were also |destroyed in this area. One occupant of a truck traveling along US |61 was killed when the tornado tossed his vehicle from the highway |to near the lumber/hardware store. A mobile/manufactured home park |on the east side of US 61 was devastated, with all 30-35 homes |destroyed. Considerable debris from these homes was rowed 300-400|yards downstream along the tornado path into an adjacent field |and stand of trees. Six occupants of these homes died in the |tornado.||The tornado remained strong to violent as it continued northeast of |Rolling Fork across mainly open fields. Through these fields, aerial |imagery revealed multiple areas of ground scarring. The tornado |crossed Matthews Rd near a catfish farm, where several utility poles |were snapped near the ground and covered in 1 to 2 inches of mud. |Some of the poles were tossed into nearby ponds. Prolific tree |damage occurred along Sandy Bayou, with a few buildings along the |outer edges of the path damaged and a tractor trailer flipped. |Another area of EF4 damage was observed from Widow Bayou and E River |Rd northeastward through Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd. Through this |corridor, extraordinary hardwood tree damage occurred with most |trees completely mangled and debarking noted. There was additional |evidence of trees or large parts of trees being tossed or dragged a |short distance. Several utility poles were snapped, with some tossed |a short distance. An outbuilding type structure off Dogwood Rd was |blown away, with a school bus from the property tossed into nearby |trees. Ground scarring and cycloidal marks were observed in the |field between Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd, along with mulched tree |debris which was rowed into a narrow line along the center of the |tornado path. Tree damage continued across Keith Rd and Charlie Pitt |Rd as the tornado approached MS Highway 14.||East of Anguilla along MS Highway 14, a frame home was completely|destroyed. Near the home, several power poles were snapped or |broken. Tree damage was extensive with large areas mowed down. A |tenth of a mile east, a mobile home was rolled into nearby trees. |Moving into Humphreys County, along Prudent Rd, most of the roof |was taken off of a home, where the garage collapsed along with a |portion of the front porch. One vehicle was flipped and another |was moved. A metal workshop was destroyed and structural beams |were bent. Along the road, several power poles were snapped and |thrown a couple hundred feet into a nearby field. As the tornado |approached and crossed Seven Mile Rd, intensity increased. Here, |several metal buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed with |structural beams bent. Grain bins had sides collapsed and the tops|blown off. A small brick home was completely destroyed with all |of the exterior walls collapsed. The home next door had a large |portion of the roof removed and part of a wall had collapsed. |Debris from the home was thrown several hundred feet into a nearby|field. Vehicles were moved out of the garage and a large grain |storage cart was thrown into the field as well. ||For several miles, the tornado traveled along MS Highway 149 |moving toward Silver City where large areas of hardwood trees were|snapped and uprooted. Multiple center pivot irrigation systems |were flipped. A mobile home was completely destroyed when it was |rolled into a nearby field. A portion of the roof was blown off a |school. A community along the same road had several homes with |significant roof damage, and at least one home had decking |material partially removed. Several homes and a large metal |building were severely damaged when portions of the roof were |blown off. A second metal building was completely destroyed with |large structural posts bent. ||As the tornado came into Silver City from the west along Highway |149, an apartment complex was heavily damaged. Several buildings |had sections of the roof removed and one building had portions of |the western walls partially collapsed. A fatality occurred in one|of the single story apartment buildings. In the nearby |neighborhood, numerous homes had roof damage. At least two frame |homes were destroyed where one or more exterior walls collapsed. A|large number of old hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. As |the storm moved east toward US 49W, more trees were snapped and |uprooted. Several homes and a church near the intersection of |MS Highway 14 and US 49W had areas of the roof damaged or |removed. Four mobile homes were completely destroyed. One person |died when a mobile home was tossed into a house, and a child died|in one of the mobile homes that was destroyed. Numerous trees |were snapped and uprooted, a few of which fell on homes. The |rating in the Silver City area ranged from EF1-EF2. ||The tornado continued to track east where mostly tree damage |occurred. In rural portions of Holmes County northeast of Tchula, |there was substantial tree damage with swaths of snapped and |uprooted trees. Several center pivot irrigation systems were |overturned and grain bins were flipped or destroyed. The tornado |continued to move northeast before dissipating in a wooded area |north of Randall Road. The maximum estimated wind gusts in Holmes County were 115 mph. The total path length was 59.35 miles across the four counties. An estimated 165 injuries were caused by this tornado, including 150 in Sharkey County and 15 in Humphreys County."

The property of a sporting range was damaged with the shooting range cover being blown across the street to the northeast.

All sides of |the mobile home sustained damage, including a large board impaled|into the roof, and some blunt force impacts from pieces of the |nearby barn that collapsed. Vehicles parked to the north and |northeast of the barn sustained heavy damage as it collapsed and |sections became airborne. Next the tornado hit a larger open- air|barn housing heavy equipment. Roof panels were torn off the west |side of the barn and sent up to 200 yards to the ENE. A little |ways down the road, another mobile home sustained blunt force |damage, including a large hole that punctured through into the |interior, as well as wind damage to all sides. Metal roofing from |the barn was found in a grove of trees to the northeast of this |house. The next door neighbor to the east faired better, but it |had debris from the metal barn in their yard, minor wind damage, |and a flagpole which was bent at the base laying northward. |Slightly farther up the road, the next property sustained major |tree damage, including several snapped trees and an uprooted tree,|though no structural damage. The tornado picked up a goat |enclosure in a grove of trees, lifted it over a fence, leaving the|fence untouched, and then tore the structure apart and twisted it|across the front yard of the property. Additional tree damage was|witnessed just past this location before the tornado lifted and |dissipated."

During a 12-hour period from 3 AM to 3 PM CST, storm total rainfall in Cook County ranged from 1-9 inches, with the highest amounts in central Cook County near the border of Chicago, Cicero, and Oak Park. The magnitude of this rainfall ranged from typical to extreme, with the peak rainfall estimated to have less than a 0.2% chance of occurring in a given year. Two distinct waves of heavy rainfall occurred in the Chicago area during this event, with each period of heavy rainfall corresponding to significant flooding.||The first wave of heavy rainfall impacted the Chicago area from 4:30 AM to 11 AM CST. Within a few hours numerous residential streets were flooded and I-290 (Eisenhower Expressway) was blocked in multiple locations, as well as a stretch of I-55 (Stevenson Expressway) near Pulaski Road. Multiple water rescues were reported, most of which occurred at underpasses in Chicago and the immediate western suburbs. Runoff quickly entered the deep tunnel system and mostly filled McCook Reservoir, greatly reducing storage capacity for additional rainfall.||After a brief period with lighter rainfall intensities from 11 AM to 12:30 PM CST, the second wave of heavy began, which occurred until 3:30 PM CST. This additional rainfall brought renewed flooding of numerous roadways as well as portions of CTA's blue and pink El train lines. The storage capacity of the deep tunnel and McCook Reservoir were exceeded, with most rainfall flowing into the Chicago River system as part of a combined sewer overflow event. The Chicago River quickly rose to minor flood stage, flooding the Chicago Riverwalk. MWRD opened gates at Chicago Lock to reverse the flow of the river into Lake Michigan, causing a mixture of rainfall and untreated sewage to enter the lake. The lack of capacity to store combined rain water and sewage caused rainfall to back up into 10s of thousands of basements. As of November 29th, 2023, FEMA had received nearly 75,000 claims for flooded homes, the majority of which are assumed to be basement flooding. Approximately $285 million in FEMA individual assistance grants were provided, along with $96.5 million in low-interest SBA loans. These federal disaster assistance programs only cover a portion of uninsured losses. Few claims, less than $1 million in total, were made to the National Flood Insurance program due to the low percentage of residents paying for such polices and the cause of most instances of flooding being related to sewer backup. The estimated total damage costs from this flash flood event are likely in excess of $500 million."

The tornado began in far western Pontotoc County, around Antioch Road, with a few trees downed and tree limbs snapped. Along Highway 9 and Houpt Road, tree damage became more significant, and a few homes and outbuildings sustained damage. A brick home on Highway 9 sustained heavy damage to the front side, mostly caused by a large uprooted tree. Damage in this area was rated EF-1. Weaker damage continued south of the Springville community before|another area of EF-1 damage was noted along Highway 341 at Foster Lane. Here a brick home sustained significant roof loss, caused partially by the uplift of an open-air carport. A few other homes had roof damage as the tornado continued to the south side of Pontotoc. A swath of more intense damage ran from Highway 15 across Highway 41 and East 10th Street, with numerous homes sustaining considerable damage. The tornado reached EF-2 intensity in this area, based on a double-wide mobile home being swept away, two brick homes having significant roof loss, and a large anchored garage being destroyed. Bolted footings that remained in place were observed in the garage. Damage to other homes in the area was rated EF-1, and many trees were uprooted, with a good number of snaps as well. Significant tree damage, along with minor structural damage, continued across Horseshoe Bend, Hall Road, and New Hope Road, maintaining EF-1 intensity. After briefly weakening near Highway 278, the tornado encountered the College Hill Lane neighborhood along Old Highway 6. Here, more significant damage was observed to structures and trees, mostly pines. A site-built home lost part of its roof, and a neighboring double-wide was swept away and scattered south and east, resulting in a fatality. Additionally, other homes sustained minor damage, and a small barber shop building was rolled and destroyed. Damage continued in the EF-0 range from Faulkner Road to near the Lee County line, |with several more homes being damaged and numerous trees being uprooted. The more severe home damage in this area appeared to be a combination of tree failure or uplift of garages/carports, thus the rating was kept at high-end EF-0. At Country Oaks Circle, a church sign and cemetery sign were blown down, and several headstones in the cemetery sustained damage. The damage path appeared to end in a grove of trees just south of Old Highway 6, and no damage was observed on County Road 41 at the Pontotoc/Lee county line. Along the track, 12 homes were destroyed and 120 were damaged.  Peak estimated winds in Pontotoc County were 120 mph.  Note that part of this tornado occurred after 12:00 am CST on April 1 and much of that data is included in April's Storm Data. The complete narrative is included in both March Storm Data and April Storm Data."

The highest rainfall totals were located at the top of the hill in the College of St. Scholastica area. Flash flooding was reported upstream from this location along Arrowhead Road where 3 to 6 inches of water was flowing over the road where Chester Creek passed under the road. As the surge of water flowed downstream, it damaged walkways along the creek and sent 2 to 5 inches of water onto side streets and Kenwood Avenue. Chester Creek runs through tunnels for much of its trip down the Duluth hillside and this volume of water overwhelmed the tunnels sending a large stream of rapidly flowing water 3 to 10 inches deep down the hill. This affected a few apartment buildings in the vicinity of 7th Avenue and 3rd Street which required a few rescues/evacuations of lower level residents and pets in the buildings by the fire department. Interstate 35 runs through tunnels underground at the base of the hill and the water surging down the hillside began to collect in the tunnels. Standing and flowing water in the tunnels resulted in the closure of the tunnels for a period. Water of at least 4 to 6 inches in depth was covering the southbound lanes in spots. The water receded during the early morning hours of the 12th with cleanup occurring over the remainder of the week."

A large area of considerable runoff flowed through Niland and the surrounding area, as evident in reports and before and after Sentinel2 satellite images, with upwards of 6 inches to 1 foot of flowing water in some areas, per photos and videos. Major flash flooding impacts were experienced. The East Highline Canal east of Niland, was overcome with flood waters and silt, mainly north of of Flowing Wells Rd. The overflowing canal was first reported a little after 1600PDT and only exacerbated the flooding. Several roads became impassable, unsafe, and subsequently closed due to flood water. At least a few cars became stuck in flood water leading to swift water rescues by land and air. The exact number of rescues is unknown. In Niland, several photos and videos showed flooded streets and yards, with water coming up to homes and businesses. There were a few reports of water entering homes, but it is unknown how many homes were impacted. Also impacted in the area was agriculture, as several fields had flood water moving through them. It is unknown the extent of any damages to the agricultural fields or the exact number. Sentinel2 satellite images showed evidence of all the disturbed earth, deposited mud and silt, through Niland, the agricultural fields and surrounding areas. In a statement by Imperial Irrigation District, the impacts to East Highline Canal resulted in a delay of 133 water deliveries. Also the O Lateral canal, which branches from East Highline canal, suffered structural damage. The main highway through the area, Hwy-111, was flooded in several locations, which hampered relief efforts. The small town of Slab City, to the northeast of Niland, was cut off from the rest of the Imperial Valley due to the flooded roads. As a result of the significant impacts, the County of Imperial issued an emergency proclamation for additional and better resources.

The rain and snowmelt in the mountains sent a flood wave to Kennebec County causing major flooding from the mountains to the coast. The USGS river gage in North Sidney crested at 32.32 feet. This is the second highest flood since the gage was established in 1979, surpassed only by the flood of 1987 which crested at 39.31 feet. There is no stage from the flood of 1936, but it is estimated that it had a stage less than 1987 but higher than 2023. The streamflows on December 19th peaked around 167 kcfs, and have an annual recurrence probability between 1% and 0.5%, otherwise referred to as a 100 or 200 year flood. The most severely impacted portion of Waterville was along Upper Main Street to Route 201 north of Willow Street, and across the southern part of town along Water Street, near the confluence of the Sebasticook River. There was severe flooding along both Libbey and Mill Island.  Dozens of homes and businesses sustained significant flood damage with water inundation several feet deep.

The heaviest rainfall and most significant snowmelt water contribution occurred across the higher terrain of the watershed, where up to 10 inches of combined rainfall and snowmelt was released into the Pemigewasset basin.  This caused the river to rise to its third highest crest at Woodstock, and 10th highest on record at Plymouth. This was also the highest crest on the Pemigewasset since Tropical Storm Irene in 2011. Estimates near the start of the watershed put the flow in the 1.0 to 0.5% chance of exceedance levels, also referred to as a 100-200 year flood event. It was less significant downstream however, with estimated flows at Woodstock being more consistent with a 25-50 year, and flows at Plymouth being more consistent with a 25 year event. The decreasing recurrence interval timeframe with downstream progress on the river highlights the significant role the higher rainfall amounts and snowmelt factored in near the top of the watershed, while relatively less input with decreasing elevation resulted in a tapering in the relative significance of the event. Damage was widespread along the Pemigewasset between Woodstock to Ashland.  In the town of Holderness, up to two feet of water entered homes and local businesses on Avery Street, South River St, and North River St.  Individuals that declined to evacuate were stuck in their homes as floodwaters entered during the early morning hours on the 19th.

The rain fell over an 18 hour period and averaged 5 inches across the basin, with an additional 2 to 3.5 inches of snowmelt.  The steep terrain and frozen ground supported rapid runoff with all streams becoming raging torrents. The USGS river gage on the Carrabassett River in North Anson climbed from 5 feet to 26.64 feet in 24 hours, narrowly missing the all time record stage of 26.66 feet set in 1987.

The streamflows were measured over 50 kcfs, which exceeds the 0.2% annual chance flood, otherwise referred to as a 500 year flood. It is estimated that the runoff caused flows of at least 500 year levels within the tributaries to the Carrabassett River including Stoddard Brook, Poplar Stream, Huston Brook, Alder Stream, Nash Brook, Stratton Brook, Redington Pond Outlet, and several others. Several dozen properties including homes and businesses were flooded and damaged during the event, with millions of dollars in damages.

The Androscoggin River only reached minor flood stage at the upstream river gage in Gorham, yet the contribution of flows from the mountains in between the two towns were sufficient to cause the river to reach major flood levels. Estimates put the Androscoggin River flows somewhere between the 0.5 to 0.2% annual chance exceedance levels, otherwise referred to as the 200 to 500 year floods. The tributaries out of the mountains are estimated to have exceeded 500 year flood levels including the Moose Brook, Moose River, Peabody River, Wild River, and Sunday Rivers. The Mill Brook ran high and contributed to the flooding in Bethel, but was not the significant contributor when compared to the other sources. The combined flows caused severe damage to properties and roads in the community, isolating the area for days.  The flooding was recorded as the 3rd highest in downstream Rumford, and estimated to be the 4th highest in Bethel since 1860. The floodwaters reached levels near, above, and just below high-water marks from the flood of 1987, though that flood had un-natural responses due to complications from river ice.  Though streamflows were likely less than that of 1987, the reported damage was worse.  The hardest hit part of the community was in town near the Kowloon Village and Bethel Wastewater Treatment facility, and north of the river along Interval Road and Route 2 & 5. Further downstream in Hanover, flooding was extensive including inundation at the town office off Route 2.  About 7 businesses in Bethel sustained major flood damage.  The cost of the damage to roads and infrastructure was estimated at $1 million. There were over a dozen homes damaged by flood water with a total cost estimated around $750,000."

As it crossed Freeman Road, a sizable portion of the roof of a brick home was removed and blown away from the property. A survey of the home including portions of the roof and rafters indicated a potential weakness of the wood. In addition, a covered porch area that shared a gabled roof with the home likely acted as a lever in lifting the roof from the home. For these reasons, the tornado damage at the site was rated slightly below the expected value for the degree of damage. The tornado then paralleled Allen Road for a short distance, snapping several pine trees, destroying two sheds, and damaging the roof of another house before lifting near the Jordan Lane intersection."

By midday on Saturday, the water levels exceeded the previous record from 2016 of 11.99 feet and impacts were increasing along the Mendenhall River. Homes along View Dr were cut off due to the significant amount of flooding over the road along with flood waters from 1 to 3 feet deep. Areas below the Mendenhall Back Loop Road bridge started to see flooding of yards and increasing bank erosion in the afternoon of August 5th.| |The river continued to rise at a fast pace through the day into the evening hours and the City of Juneau then set up their Emergency Operations Center. In the evening hours, many areas (roads and homes) below Mendenhall Back Loop Road bridge along the Mendenhall River were experiencing moderate flooding along with significant bank erosion of 50 to 200 feet. From that bank erosion one home fell into the river with another large 3 story condominium building was evacuated as it became compromised and could also fall into the river. Going into the late evening hours a portion of another house fell into the river with many other homes along the river being undermined and at risk of falling into the river.  Homes and roads around Meander Way, Marion Dr, River Court and Killewich Rd flooded with moderate impacts in the late evening and the local electric company cut power to those residences due to flood waters being 2 to 4 feet deep. ||The river crested near 14.97 feet (preliminary crest from the USGS) around 11:30 PM AKDT on August 5th. At the peak of the event there was 3 to 7 feet of water in and around homes along View Dr. The Mendenhall Lake and River were back below minor flood stage of 9.0 feet by 9:45 AM AKDT on Sunday, August 6th.||While other locations in the Mendenhall Valley, above Mendenhall Back Loop Road bridge, have experienced flooding impacts from these types of events in the past, they saw major damage this time around. This event was 3 feet higher than the previous record from 2016 and the Mendenhall Lake and River rose approximately 9.42 feet.||In the end there were about 48 homes affected with 13 destroyed, 8 with major damage and 7 with minor.
