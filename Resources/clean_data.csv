The rainfall totals of 2 inches and melting snow on already saturated ground led to rapid runoff of small streams and rivers along coastal watersheds.

This interaction led to flash flooding at the time of high tide, causing numerous low lying back-bay areas to flood, along with increased urban flooding in the city of Portland as storm drains became overwhelmed. Back bay flooding was reported on Marginal Way with the closing of exit 7 off of I-295. Many businesses were flooded in the back bay area as the freshwater couldn't drain to the ocean. Additional flooding was reported on the waterfront area with storm drains also being a small contributing factor during high tide."

The tornado began 1.75 miles south of the City of Bamberg|along US Hwy 601, near Cry Baby Road.||Moving north, the tornado then proceeded to flip a mobile home and cause substantial|EF2 damage to a barrel plant at the intersection of US Hwy 601 and US Hwy 301. Door|and window failure contributed to the collapse of the middle section of the building|and partial collapse of the front section. The collapsed portions of the building were|tossed across Chevrolet St into a water tower.||The tornado continued north-northeast along US-301 causing widespread EF1 roof and|tree damage before moving into downtown Bamberg.||As the tornado entered downtown Bamberg, it strengthened to EF2 intensity and|caused substantial structural damage to a series of 2-3 story historic buildings just|south of the intersection of US Hwy 78 and US Hwy 301. The newer roof section of a|building on the west side of US Hwy 301 was thrown completely off onto the adjacent|structure. There was a complete collapse of the upper stories of two buildings on the|east side of US Hwy 301 with the corner torn off another. Preexisting missing portions|of the roof and gaps in the exterior wall of the former City Hall likely contributed to its|collapse due to wind intrusion. ||The tornado then moved north and quickly weakened as it crossed US Hwy 78 before|dissipating 0.4 miles north of downtown Bamberg along US Hwy 301.||The National Weather Service would like to thank wind engineers from the Insurance|Institute for Business and Home Safety for their expertise assisting with surveying|some of the structural damage."

Once it reached just east of Perry Road and north of Bull Creek, it snapped and uprooted dozens of mostly pine trees across a large wooded area of a private residence. In this area it also uplifted the roof of a steel outbuilding and destroyed the garage door. Maximum wind speeds in this area were estimated to be near 100 mph.

The Houston county portion of the tornado is rated EF2 with max winds estimated at 130 mph. This tornado touched down in a swampy area, just east of Holmes Creek in northwest Jackson County. The tornado initially uprooted and snapped several softwood and hardwood trees, along Hickshill Road and in addition, it damaged an outbuilding there. The tornado continued northeast, damaging more hardwood and softwood trees along Piano Road. The first structure to be impacted by this tornado was a double-wide manufactured home on the northern side of Piano Road. Additional softwood and hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted along Danford Bay Road. Tree damage continued along Orchid Road, Damascus Church Road and Layton Road as the tornado continued to progress northeastward. An outbuilding was damaged along Orchid Road, and a single-family home suffered significant roof damage along Layton Road. The tornado then destroyed two ninety foot, seventy-year-old concrete silos. Damage was found along the entire length of Everett Road which was composed of the snapping and uprooting of trees, along with damage to an outbuilding and a mobile home succumbing to window damage. More trees were damaged along Heislar Road and Peanut Road as the tornado continued its northeastward trek. A single-family home on Peanut Road suffered significant roof damage. When the tornado reached Shiloh Church Loop, a single-family home suffered significant roof damage. The tornado continued to move northeast across Highway 2 where more softwood and hardwood trees were uprooted and snapped. Most of the damage to this point is classified as EF-1. Before the tornado crossed into Alabama, it damaged the roof of a small business on US-231. After crossing into Houston County Alabama, the tornado produced a continuous swath of damage on either side of State Line Road all the way towards the city of Cottonwood. This is also consistent of EF-1 damage. The first instance of EF-2 damage was when the tornado approached Cottonwood proper, along Ramer Loop rolling a single-wide mobile home, destroying it, despite it being well strapped.   As the tornado moved through downtown Cottonwood, numerous small businesses sustained damage, ranging from blown out windows, roof damage and in one case the failure of the front-facing brick facade. Additional EF-2 damage occurred when the tornado removed the entire roof of a large two-story home. The tornado continued its northeastward jog, leaving Cottonwood proper, and commenced to destroy a two-story Moose Lodge that was composed of cinder-blocks resulting in another instance of EF-2 damage. The most significant tree damage noted on this survey occurred when the tornado paralleled Dyers Road, thus snapping numerous hardwood and softwood trees. The most significant damage along this northeastward path occurred on September Road where a double-wide home was completely destroyed, and resulted in one fatality. As the tornado continued to move northeast to across Whitaker Road and Creek Church Road, EF-1 tree damage was noted. The tornado caused mainly EF-0 damage to softwood and hardwood trees along Green Frog Road and Ed Tolar Road. One last structural damage occurred to a single-family home where it caused significant roof damage before lifting near the Chattahoochee River. In summary, while most damage was EF-1, there were instances of EF-2 damage with the max wind of 130 mph. In addition to the one fatality, there were also ten direct injuries from the tornado and an additional six indirect injuries during the response phase of the disaster, all in the Cottonwood area.

The damage at these two locations support the maximum rating of the tornado of EF-2 with an approximate maximum wind speed of 120 mph.

Within the plantation, one structure was damaged from an uprooted tree landing on a portion of the building. Several other cottages suffered some shingle loss, with one structure losing the bottom portion of the wood frame around the building and another having minor chimney damage. A couple of open air barns had damage, with one having a wall collapse and another being slightly shifted off its foundation. Beyond the structures, numerous large pine trees were uprooted or snapped. When the tornado was near peak intensity several large pine trees were snapped in close proximity with several very large pine trees uprooted. Tree damage was noted beyond reachable distance due to the downed trees blocking the path further into the woods. From surveying on the northwest side of the track along an accessible road, no additional damage was noted, and the tornado is presumed to have lifted before reaching B Green Road and Parramore Fish Pond Road.

The tornado tracked almost due north-northeast along Highway 1011 before curving slightly northwest at the end. This was confirmed via radar. The west side of the road sustained the heaviest damage, all to manufactured homes. Only one actual mobile home was flipped and thrown into the fire station. This was noted to be of very degraded construction with only one strap seen. None of the homes surveyed had a sustained load path with strapping. A few were pushed slightly off their foundations with roof damage and undercarriage damage. To the east of Highway1011, these were well-built homes with only tree damage and minor roof/gutter damage. We do believe the tornado was wide enough to cause damage on both sides but the construction was better on theeast side, hence the lower damage. Around the intersections of Highway 1, Highway 1011, and Highway 308, there were trees down, a few pieces of roof pulled off and damage to a thrift store. The|concrete blocks at the top were pushed off with significant roof damage. Throughout the track, debris was noted well away from where it came from, with the thrift store's roof both to the eastand to the west. Debris indentations in the ground were widely seen and debris splatter was noted on all sides of the buildings. Also to note, off to the east on Highway 1014, power poles were leaning in one direction with very minor siding damage to a few manufactured homes. This is well away from the track and the damage is either straight-line winds or inflow from the tornado."
